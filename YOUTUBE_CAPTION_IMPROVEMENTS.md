# YouTube Caption Improvements

## Overview
The YouTube caption feature has been completely revamped to provide a better viewing experience and seamless integration with YouTube's native caption system.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Native Caption Integration** âœ¨
The extension now **directly replaces YouTube's built-in captions** instead of showing them in a separate overlay. This provides:
- Seamless viewing experience
- Captions appear exactly where you expect them
- No overlapping UI elements
- Better readability with YouTube's native caption styling

### 2. **Full Caption Display**
- **All caption text is now fully visible** (no more truncation)
- Increased font size from 16px to 20px for better readability
- Better line height (1.6) for comfortable reading
- Wider max-width (90% instead of 80%) to accommodate longer text
- Proper word wrapping with `white-space: pre-wrap`

### 3. **Smart Caching System**
- Captions are cached after first adjustment
- Instant display for repeated captions
- Significantly reduces API calls
- Smoother playback experience

### 4. **Improved Toggle Button**
- Now shows current CEFR level (e.g., "Hilo B1")
- Visual icon indicator (ðŸ¤– when enabled, ðŸ“š when disabled)
- Better styling with rounded corners and shadow
- Hover animation (subtle scale effect)
- Positioned at bottom-right for easy access

### 5. **Automatic Settings Sync**
- Respects your CEFR level from extension settings
- Automatically updates when settings change
- Clears cache when level changes to ensure accurate adjustments

## How It Works

### Native Integration Mode (Default)
1. YouTube displays its normal captions
2. When Hilo is enabled, the extension:
   - Detects the original caption text
   - Adjusts it to your selected CEFR level
   - **Directly replaces** the text in YouTube's caption area
   - Stores the original text as a data attribute
3. When Hilo is disabled:
   - All captions are restored to their original text
   - No visual artifacts remain

### Caption Processing Flow
```
Original Caption â†’ Check Cache â†’ [Cached? Show immediately]
                                â†“
                         [Not cached? Adjust via AI]
                                â†“
                         [Cache result & display]
```

### Technical Details
- **Storage**: Original captions stored in `data-hilo-original` attribute
- **Indicator**: Adjusted captions marked with `data-hilo-adjusted="true"`
- **Restoration**: One-click restoration removes all modifications
- **Performance**: Cache prevents redundant API calls

## Usage Instructions

1. **Navigate to any YouTube video** with captions enabled
2. **Enable YouTube's native captions** (click the CC button)
3. **Click the "Hilo" toggle button** in the bottom-right corner
4. **Watch as captions are adjusted** to your selected CEFR level in real-time
5. **Toggle off** to see original captions again
